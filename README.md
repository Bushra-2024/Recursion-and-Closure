# Recursion-and-Closure
Here is short information about important JavaScript topics: Recursion and Closures


## Recursion
Recursion is a process where a function calls itself repeatdly to solve a problem. It is useful for problems that can be divided into smaller, similar sub-problems.

Key Points:
- Base Case and Recursive Case:
A recursive function must have a base case to stop the recursion; otherwise, it can lead to infinite calls and cause a stack overflow.
- Applications:
Recursion is commonly used for tasks such as traversing trees, solving mathematical problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci), and implementing algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.
